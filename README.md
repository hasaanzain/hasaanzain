## About Me

Hasaan Mohsin is an aspiring data scientist who recently graduated from the University of Toronto with an Honours Bachelor of Science in Physics and Astronomy, where he contributed to research in large-scale data modeling, exoplanet habitability, and statistical analysis. His technical expertise includes Python (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn), SQL (Advanced), R, cloud services(Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, AWS), and data visualization platforms such as Tableau/Power BI. He is also experienced in machine learning, data pipelines, and ETL processes.

In addition to his data expertise, Hasaan is an aspiring astronaut and astronautics student with the International Institute for Astronautical Sciences ([IIAS](https://astronauticsinstitute.org/)). He has completed hands-on training in zero gravity flight, spacesuit operations, hypoxia awareness, high-G aerobatic flights, suborbital flight simulations, and scientific imagery missions. Beyond this, he is a certified open water scuba diver, licensed airplane pilot, amateur skydiver, and fluent in multiple languages.
